            The roots of Georgian
            viticulture have been traced back by archeology to when people of the
            South Caucasus discovered that wild grape juice turned into wine when
            it was left buried through the winter in a shallow pit. This knowledge
            was nourished by experience, and from 6000 BC inhabitants of the current
            Georgia were cultivating grapes and burying clay vessels, kvevris, in which
            to store their wine ready for serving at ground temperature. When filled with
            the fermented juice of the harvest, the kvevris are topped with a wooden
            lid and then covered and sealed with earth. Some may remain entombed for up to 50 years.
            Due to its diverse and unique microclimate, there are about 500 grape varieties in modern Georgia.

            Wine vessels of every shape, size and design
            have been the crucial part of pottery in Georgia for millennia.
            Ancient artifacts attest to the high skill of local craftsmen. Among vessels, the most ubiquitous and unique
            to Georgian wine-making culture are probably the Kvevris,
            very large earthenware vessels with an inside coat of beeswax. Not only kvevris were used to
            ferment grape juice and to store up wine, but also chapi and satskhao; others yet
            were used for drinking, such as khelada, doki, sura, chinchila, deda-khelada, dzhami and marani.

            The continuous importance of winemaking and drinking in Georgian culture is also visible in
            various antique works of art. Many of the unearthed silver, gold and bronze artifacts of the
            3rd and 2nd millennia BC bear chased imprints of the vine, grape clusters and leaves.
            The State Museum of Georgia has on display a cup of high-carat gold set with gems,
            an ornamented silver pitcher and some other artifacts dated to the 2nd millennium BC.
            From classical Antiquity, Georgian museums display a cameo depicting Bacchus,
            and numerous sarcophagi with wine pitchers and ornamented wine cups found in ancient tombs.

            Traditional Georgian grape varieties are little known in the World.
            Now that the wines of Eastern and Central Europe are coming to international
            awareness, grapes from this region are becoming better known. Although there are nearly 400 to
            choose from, only 38 varieties are officially grown for commercial viticulture in Georgia

            Georgia's territorial and climate conditions are optimal for wine-making.
            Extremes of weather are unusual: summers tend to be short-sleeve sunny, and
            winters mild and frost-free. Natural springs abound, and the Caucasian Mountain
            streams drain mineral-rich water into the valleys. Georgia's moderate climate and
            moist air, influenced by the Black Sea, provide the best conditions for vine cultivating.
            The soil in vineyards is so intensively cultivated that the grapevines grow up the trunks
            of fruit trees eventually hanging down along the fruit when they ripen. This method of
            cultivation is called maglari.
